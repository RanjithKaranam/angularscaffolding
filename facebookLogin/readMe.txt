Hi,

For testapp, it is a runnable code to retrieve facebook information. And it is an Angular Module.

When I tried to implemented into the AngularAMD and RequireJS framework, I followed the syntax in configuration and so on.
But I think I couldn't register the loginController, and the config in boostrapApp.js is working.
After google searching for these days, I still don't know how to fix.
In the bootstrapApp.js, I config the facebookProvider with my facebook appId, but use it in loginController.
There are several console.log in loginController:
The first console.log is showing, indicating that calling the app is correct.
The second console.log is not showing, probably meaning registering controller is bad.

Hopefully you could help me. Many thanks.
